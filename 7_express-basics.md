## Express basics

You have two options this morning for challenges. 

Your first option is to complete the [freecodecamp express.js challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express). I recommend you do this. 

These challenges have tests and will get you accustom to writing with the express syntax before we dive into it deeper today.

I have created a [video on how to get setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-RRdQC442E&feature=youtu.be) as it can be confusing to understand what's required for freecodecamp to work.

Note that you need to use Google Chrome and you need to be signed in on Glitch (via Github)  for the Glitch web app to work correctly.

If it doesn't work the first time sign in to Glitch, then close the tab and then reopen Glitch again from freecodecamp. 

Your second option is similar to yesterday's challenge; creating a function that passes some mocha tests.

You can find the [mocha tests challenge here](https://gist.github.com/scottdixon/091fb45326ee6fe2b70c32765f720b6e).
