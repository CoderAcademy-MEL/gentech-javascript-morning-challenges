### Mongoose populate

Read through the mongoose documentation for [populate](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html).

Think about some kind of simple data structure; like doctors, patients and appointments.

An appointment document should have reference to a patient and doctor document.

Formulate your data structure as mongoose schemas (or just one schema if you want to nest).

If you get time create an express API that allows you to POST doctors, patients and appointments.
