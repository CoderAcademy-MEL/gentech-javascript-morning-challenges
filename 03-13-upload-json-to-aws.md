### Upload JSON to AWS S3

This is part two of Monday's morning challenge. Please complete this challenge before starting with this. We'll review the Monday part of the challenge first thing today. 

Today I want you to upload the JSON file that we created on Monday to AWS S3. You can create a new bucket and upload the file manually. You then need to make sure public permissions are turned on.

Once this is complete create a front end directory with an `index.html` and `script.js`. Make a fetch request to the link the JSON file is stored on.

Display all the names, times, genders and years on the page in an ordered list.

This is what I expect the [website to look like at the end](https://tan-best-times.netlify.com/).
