## Express basics continued

You have three options this morning for challenges. 

Firstly, I'm happy for you to continue working on the [freecodecamp express.js challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express) I posted yesterday. 

Secondly, I'd like you to work on the [express challenge](https://gist.github.com/DeepNeuralAI/8b6e5e9e4d92001dd66cf13ec0eba5bf) we started yesterday afternoon. Come see teachers for help.

If you complete everything including phase 2 try separating your front end and your back end code into completely separate directories. Run your front end code with live server. How do we deal with the CORS errors?

Thirdly, I have another [mocha test challenge](https://gist.github.com/scottdixon/6f86015d75fb3147c88226d57e88ab50).
